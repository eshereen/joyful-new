```bash
# Upload optimized files
# Run migration safely
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
php artisan migrate

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Run performance optimization
php artisan optimize:performance
```

## 📊 Monitoring Performance

### **GTmetrix Testing**
1. Test homepage performance
2. Test product index page
3. Test product show page
4. Monitor Core Web Vitals

### **Key Metrics to Watch**
- First Contentful Paint (target: < 1.0s)
- Speed Index (target: < 3.5s)
- Largest Contentful Paint (target: < 2.5s)
- Time to Interactive (target: < 1.6s)

## 🔧 Additional Optimizations (Future)

### **CDN Implementation**
- Set up CDN for static assets
- Configure image CDN for media files

### **Database Indexing**
- Add composite indexes for common queries
- Implement full-text search for products

### **Caching Strategy**
